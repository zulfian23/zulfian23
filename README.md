**Full Stack Web Developer (Laravel + MySQL) | Linux Enthusiast | Ex-Python Dev**

---

I'm a **Full Stack Web Developer** with a strong foundation in **Linux** and **open-source development**.

Currently, I work as a **Database Administrator** at a Civil Registration Office, primarily maintaining and monitoring existing systems, where I also build and maintain **Laravel + MySQL** web applications to support administrative workflows.

Before diving deep into web development, I spent years exploring the world of Linux and Python. Back in university (2009â€“2010), I tinkered with various Linux distributions (Slackware, Mandriva, OpenSUSE, Ubuntu, Debian/Backtrack) on a modest 2GB RAM laptop, built desktop applications with **Python + GTK**, and created my own text editor called **Jollpi** as part of my final project. 

I enjoy creating practical, efficient systems that solve real-world problems.  
I continue to use Linux (currently Manjaro) as my daily driver, and that mindset â€” open source spirit, practicality, and adaptability â€” still defines how I work today.

ðŸš€ **Currently expanding my skills and open to exploring new opportunities where I can contribute and grow further.**
